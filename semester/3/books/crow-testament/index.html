        1<br>
        Cain lifts Crow, that heavy black bird<br>
        and strikes down Abel.<br><br>

        Damn, says Crow, I guess<br>
        this is just the beginning.<br><br>

        2<br>
        The white man, disguised<br>
        as a falcon, swoops in<br>
        and yet again steals a salmon<br>
        from Crow's talons.<br><br>

        Damn, says Crow, if I could swim<br>
        I would have fled this country years ago.<br><br>

        3<br>
        The Crow God as depicted<br>
        in all of the reliable Crow bibles<br>
        looks exactly like a Crow.<br><br>

        Damn, says Crow, this makes it<br>
        so much easier to worship myself.<br><br>

        4<br>
        Among the ashes of Jericho,<br>
        Crow sacrifices his firstborn son.<br><br>

        Damn, says Crow, a million nests<br>
        are soaked with blood.<br><br>

        5<br>
        When Crows fight Crows<br>
        the sky fills with beaks and talons.<br><br>

        Damn, says Crow, it's raining feathers.<br><br>

        6<br>
        Crow flies around the reservation<br>
        and collects empty beer bottles<br><br>

        but they are so heavy<br>
        he can only carry one at a time.<br><br>

        So, one by one, he returns them<br>
        but gets only five cents a bottle.<br><br>

        Damn, says Crow, redemption<br>
        is not easy.<br><br>

        7<br>
        Crow rides a pale horse<br>
        into a crowded powwow<br>
        but none of the Indian panic.<br><br>

        Damn, says Crow, I guess<br>
        they already live near the end of the world.
