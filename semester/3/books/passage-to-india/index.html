        <h3 class="part-no">1</h3>
        Singing my days,<br>
        Singing the great achievements of the present,<br>
        Singing the strong, light works of engineers,<br>
        Our modern wonders, (the antique ponderous Seven outvied,)<br>
        In the Old World the east the Suez canal,<span class="line-no">5</span><br>
        The New by its mighty railroad spann'd,<br>
        The seas inlaid with eloquent gentle wires,<br>
        Yet first to sound, and ever sound, the cry with thee O soul,<br>

        The Past! the Past! the Past!<br>
        The Past--the dark, unfathom'd retrospect!<span class="line-no">10</span><br>
        The teeming gulf--the sleepers and the shadows!<br>
        The past--the infinite greatness of the past!<br>
        For what is the present after all but a growth out of the past? <br>
        (As a projectile form'd, impell'd, passing a certain<br>
        line, still keeps on,<br>
        So the present, utterly form'd, impell'd by the past.)

        <h3 class="part-no">2</h3>
        Passage O soul to India!<br>
        Eclaircise the myths Asiatic, the primitive fables.<br><br>

        Not you alone proud truths of the world,<br>
        Nor you alone ye facts of modern science,<br>
        But myths and fables of eld, Asia's, Africa's fables,<br>
        The far-darting beams of the spirit, the unloos'd dreams,<br>
        The deep diving bibles and legends,<br>
        The daring plots of the poets, the elder religions;<br>
        O you temples fairer than lilies pour'd over by the rising sun! <br>
        O you fables spurning the known, eluding the hold of the known, mounting to heaven!<span class="line-no">25</span><br>
        You lofty and dazzling towers, pinnacled, red as roses, burnish'd with gold!<br>
        Towers of fables immortal fashion'd from mortal dreams!<br>
        You too I welcome and fully the same as the rest;<br>
        You too with joy I sing.<br>
        Passage to India! <span class="line-no">30</span><br>
        Lo, soul, seest thou not God's purpose from the first? <br>
        The earth to be spann'd, connected by network,<br>
        The races, neighbors, to marry and be given in marriage,<br>
        The oceans to be cross'd, the distant brought near,<br>
        The lands to be welded together.<span class="line-no">35</span><br>

        A worship new I sing,<br>
        You captains, voyagers, explorers, yours,<br>
        You engineers, you architects, machinists, yours,<br>
        You, not for trade or transportation only,<br>
        But in God's name, and for thy sake O soul.<span class="line-no">40</span>

        <h3 class="part-no">3</h3>
        Passage to India!<br>
        Lo soul for thee of tableaus twain,<br>
        I see in one the Suez canal initiated, open'd,<br>
        I see the procession of steamships, the Empress Eugenie's leading the van;<br>
        I mark from on deck the strange landscape, the pure sky, the level sand in the distance,<span class="line-no">45</span><br>
        I pass swiftly the picturesque groups, the workmen gather'd,<br>
        The gigantic dredging machines.<br><br>

        In one again, different, (yet thine, all thine, O soul, the same,)<br>
        I see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting every barrier;<br>
        I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte, carrying freight and passengers, <span class="line-no">50</span><br>
        I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring, and the shrill steam-whistle,<br>
        I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the world,<br>
        I cross the Laramie plains, I note the rocks in grotesque shapes, the buttes,<br>
        I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions, the barren, colorless, sage-deserts,<br>
        I see in glimpses afar or towering immediately above me, the great mountains- <br>I see the Wind River and the Wahsatch mountains, <span class="line-no">55</span><br>
        I see the Monument mountain and the Eagle's Nest, I
        pass the Promontory,<br> I ascend the Nevadas,<br>
        I scan the noble Elk mountain, and wind around its base,<br>
        I see the Humboldt range, I thread the valley and cross the river, <br>
        I see the clear waters of Lake Tahoe, I see forests of majestic pines, <br>
        Or crossing the great desert, the alkaline plains, I behold enchanting mirages of waters and
        meadows, <span class="line-no">60</span><br>
        Marking through these and after all, in duplicate slender lines,<br>
        Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel,<br>
        Tying the Eastern to the Western sea,<br>
        The road between Europe and Asia.<br><br>

        (Ah Genoese, thy dream! thy dream!<br>
        Centuries after thou art laid in thy grave,<br>
        The shore thou foundest verifies thy dream.)<span class="line-no">65</span>

        <h3 class="part-no">4</h3>

        Passage to India!<br>
        Struggles of many a captain, tales of many a sailor dead,<br>
        Over my mood stealing and spreading they come,<span class="line-no">70</span><br>
        Like clouds and cloudlets in the unreach'd sky.<br>
        Along all history, down the slopes, <br>
        As a rivulet running, sinking now, and now again to the surface rising,<br>
        A ceaseless thought, a varied train--lo, soul, to thee, thy sight, they rise,<br>
        The plans, the voyages again, the expeditions: <span class="line-no">75</span><br>
        Again Vasco de Gama sails forth;<br>
        Again the knowledge gain'd, the mariner's compass,<br>
        Lands found, and nations born, thou born America, (a hemisphere unborn,)<br>
        For purpose vast, man's long probation fill'd,<br>
        Thou rondure of the world at last accomplish'd.<span class="line-no">80</span>
