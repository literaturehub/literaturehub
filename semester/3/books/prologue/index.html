    <div class="content">
To sing of Wars, of Captains, and of Kings,<br>
Of Cities founded, Common-wealths begun,<br>
For my mean Pen are too superior things;<br>
Or how they all, or each their dates have run,<br>
Let Poets and Historians set these forth.<br>
My obscure lines shall not so dim their worth.<br><br>

But when my wond’ring eyes and envious heart<br>
Great Bartas’ sugar’d lines do but read o’er,<br>
Fool, I do grudge the Muses did not part<br>
‘Twixt him and me that over-fluent store.<br>
A Bartas can do what a Bartas will<br>
But simple I according to my skill.<br><br>

From School-boy’s tongue no Rhet’ric we expect,<br>
Nor yet a sweet Consort from broken strings,<br>
Nor perfect beauty where’s a main defect.<br>
My foolish, broken, blemished Muse so sings,<br>
And this to mend, alas, no Art is able,<br>
‘Cause Nature made it so irreparable.<br><br>

Nor can I, like that fluent sweet-tongued Greek<br>
Who lisp’d at first, in future times speak plain.<br>
By Art he gladly found what he did seek,<br>
A full requital of his striving pain.<br>
Art can do much, but this maxim’s most sure:<br>
A weak or wounded brain admits no cure.<br><br>

I am obnoxious to each carping tongue<br>
Who says my hand a needle better fits.<br>
A Poet’s Pen all scorn I should thus wrong,<br>
For such despite they cast on female wits.<br>
If what I do prove well, it won’t advance,<br>
They’ll say it’s stol’n, or else it was by chance.<br><br>

But sure the antique Greeks were far more mild,<br>
Else of our Sex, why feigned they those nine<br>
And poesy made Calliope’s own child?<br>
So ‘mongst the rest they placed the Arts divine,<br>
But this weak knot they will full soon untie.<br>
The Greeks did nought but play the fools and lie.<br><br>

Let Greeks be Greeks, and Women what they are.<br>
Men have precedency and still excel;<br>
It is but vain unjustly to wage war.<br>
Men can do best, and Women know it well.<br>
Preeminence in all and each is yours;<br>
Yet grant some small acknowledgement of ours.<br><br>

And oh ye high flown quills that soar the skies,<br>
And ever with your prey still catch your praise,<br>
If e’er you deign these lowly lines your eyes,<br>
Give thyme or Parsley wreath, I ask no Bays.<br>
This mean and unrefined ore of mine<br>
Will make your glist’ring gold but more to shine.<br><br>
